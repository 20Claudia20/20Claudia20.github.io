        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          Born in sunny California moved to Ohio and found my self in the middle of a booming
          tech city. My interest in Software Development sparked while I was working at a Tech startup, where I was first
          exposed to the developers life. Teamwork, problem solving and attention to details traits came natural to me. 
          I quickly realized that it's not just about coding but being creative building something out of an mere idea.
          I am thrilled to join this thriving industry and see projects come to life.
